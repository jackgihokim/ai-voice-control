# Voice Recognition Reset Test Verification

## Test Date: 2025-08-28

### Changes Implemented:

1. **VoiceRecognitionEngine.swift**
   - Added `resetAllTextBuffers()` function to clear `recognizedText`, `currentTranscription` and reset WakeWordDetector
   - Modified `stopListening()` to call `resetAllTextBuffers()` automatically

2. **WakeWordDetector.swift**
   - Updated reset notification handler to always reset on "completeReset" events
   - Only ignores "stopListening" events when processing wake words

3. **VoiceControlStateManager.swift**
   - Made clipboard clearing optional (default: false)
   - Added `clearClipboard` parameter to `completeReset()` and `clearAllTextBuffers()`
   - Now calls `voiceEngine?.resetAllTextBuffers()` directly

### Test Scenarios:

#### 1. Wake Word Detection Reset
- [ ] Say wake word (e.g., "Claude")
- [ ] Verify all text buffers are cleared
- [ ] Verify clipboard is NOT cleared
- [ ] Verify new session starts cleanly

#### 2. Enter Key Reset
- [ ] Type some text
- [ ] Press Enter
- [ ] Verify text buffers are cleared
- [ ] Verify clipboard is NOT cleared
- [ ] Verify text field is NOT cleared

#### 3. 59-Second Auto-Restart
- [ ] Start voice recognition
- [ ] Wait for 59-second timeout
- [ ] Verify text buffers are cleared
- [ ] Verify session restarts cleanly

#### 4. Manual Stop/Start
- [ ] Click Stop button
- [ ] Click Start button
- [ ] Verify all text buffers are cleared
- [ ] Verify no previous text remains

#### 5. Error Recovery Reset
- [ ] Trigger an error (e.g., disable microphone)
- [ ] Re-enable and restart
- [ ] Verify clean state after error

### Expected Behavior:

1. **Text Buffers**: Should be completely cleared on every reset
2. **Clipboard**: Should NOT be cleared unless explicitly requested
3. **Wake Word State**: Should reset properly on "completeReset" events
4. **UI State**: Should reflect cleared buffers immediately
5. **Session Continuity**: New sessions should start with no remnants from previous sessions

### Debug Output to Monitor:

```
ðŸ§¹ VoiceRecognitionEngine: All text buffers reset
ðŸ”„ WakeWordDetector: Received reset notification (reason: completeReset)
ðŸ§¹ Clearing all text buffers (clipboard: no)
ðŸ“‹ Clipboard cleared (only if explicitly requested)
```

### Issues Fixed:

1. âœ… VoiceRecognitionEngine wasn't clearing text buffers on stop
2. âœ… WakeWordDetector was ignoring some necessary reset events
3. âœ… Clipboard was being cleared unnecessarily, losing user data
4. âœ… Timing inconsistencies between components during reset

### Verification Steps:

1. Build the app: `xcodebuild -project AIVoiceControl.xcodeproj -scheme AIVoiceControl -configuration Debug build`
2. Run the app: `/Users/jackkim/VibeProjects/AIVoiceControl/DerivedData/AIVoiceControl/Build/Products/Debug/AIVoiceControl.app/Contents/MacOS/AIVoiceControl`
3. Test each scenario above
4. Monitor console output for debug messages
5. Verify no text persistence between sessions
