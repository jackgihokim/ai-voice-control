# Buffer Contamination Fix Summary

## Problem
After voice recognition reset (both 59-second timer and Enter key), text buffers and clipboard were not fully cleared, causing previous text to contaminate new voice input sessions.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Command+V Execution**: An unnecessary Command+V was being executed in `clearActiveAppTextField`, which could paste clipboard content back into the field
2. **Voice Engine Text Restoration**: The voice recognition engine was not clearing its internal text states (`recognizedText`, `currentTranscription`) during `stopListening`
3. **Immediate Text Recognition**: After `startListening`, the engine would immediately process any residual text from the previous session

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Command+V
**File**: `VoiceControlStateManager.swift`
- Removed Command+V simulation from `clearActiveAppTextField`
- Only use Command+A + Delete to clear text field content

### 2. Clear Voice Engine Text States
**File**: `VoiceRecognitionEngine.swift`
- Added text state clearing in `stopListening`:
  ```swift
  recognizedText = ""
  currentTranscription = ""
  ```

### 3. Ignore Initial Text After Restart
**File**: `VoiceRecognitionEngine.swift`
- Added `ignoreInitialText` flag and timer
- Ignore any text recognition for 500ms after `startListening`
- Prevents processing of residual text from previous session

### 4. Final Buffer Verification
**File**: `VoiceRecognitionEngine.swift`
- Added 300ms delayed buffer check after `startListening`
- Force-clears any contaminated buffers if detected
- Logs detailed state for debugging

### 5. Reordered Reset Operations
**File**: `VoiceControlStateManager.swift`
- Clear text field BEFORE clearing buffers in `completeReset`
- Prevents text field content from re-contaminating cleared buffers

## Debug Logging Enhancements
Added comprehensive logging throughout the reset process:
- Buffer states before/after clearing
- Clipboard content at each step
- Voice engine text states
- Initial text ignore period tracking

## Testing Checklist
1. ✅ Voice input followed by 59-second timer reset
2. ✅ Voice input followed by Enter key reset
3. ✅ Multiple consecutive resets
4. ✅ Reset during active voice recognition
5. ✅ Buffer and clipboard state verification after reset

## Result
- Buffers and clipboard are now properly cleared during reset
- No text contamination between voice sessions
- Clean state for new voice input after reset
- Consistent behavior between timer and Enter key resets
